# Python Learning Log
This is where I‚Äôll track my progress learning Python and SQL.


## Week 1 of [Date: Aug 18, 2025] - Python Fundamentals

### üß† Concepts Learned
- Variables and their different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans).
- Basic arithmetic and string concatenation.
- The difference between lists ([]) and dictionaries ({}).
- How to access and modify items in lists and dictionaries.
- Using simple conditional logic with `if/else` statements.

### üìÅ Code Files Created
- `day1_part2.py`: Practiced variables, strings, lists, and dictionaries.
- `day2_control_flow.py`: Implemented `if/else` statements for basic logic.

### üí° Key Takeaway
This week, I learned that while Python's syntax is new, the underlying logic is very similar to what I'm used to with PLCs. The new `f-string` method for formatting text is a powerful and easy-to-use feature. I'm starting to see how these fundamental concepts will be used to process data from our historian.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Week's Plan
Next week, I will be focusing on SQL fundamentals, including basic queries, filtering data with the `WHERE` clause, and inserting new data.

## Week 2 of [Date: Aug 25, 2025]: SQL Fundamentals

Concepts Learned: Creating relational databases, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and using PRAGMA.

Key Projects: Modeled a multi-table database to match a real-world PLC tag hierarchy.

Key Takeaway: Learned to combine JOIN, WHERE, and GROUP BY to perform complex analysis, and gained a clear understanding of the differences between flat and relational data models.
