OT Data Analytics Project with Gemini - My Study Partner
This repository serves as a portfolio for my journey in learning Python and SQL for data analysis and engineering. Each file in this repository corresponds to a daily lesson.

ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Learning and Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort with an AI assistant (Gemini). This process allowed me to develop crucial skills in:

Prompt Engineering: Effectively communicating complex project goals to an AI.

Critical Validation: Analyzing and refining AI-generated code and methodologies to ensure they adhere to best practices.

Structured Learning: Designing a custom, disciplined learning path and tracking progress in a professional manner.

ðŸš€ Capstone Project: Sensor Health and Data Analysis Pipeline
This project is a culmination of the first chapter of my Python study. The goal was to build a data pipeline that simulates real-world sensor data, identifies anomalies and flatlining signals, and analyzes the correlation between different process variables (flow and pressure).

Key Skills Applied:

Data Simulation and Generation (Python)

Data Loading and Transformation (Pandas)

Statistical Analysis and Anomaly Detection (NumPy)

Filtering, Merging, and Data Cleaning

Time-series and Time Zone Handling

ðŸ“… Weekly Log
Week 3 Summary: Advanced Pandas
Date Range: 09/01/2025 - 09/15/2025

This week, I dove into more advanced data manipulation with Pandas. I learned how to work with NumPy arrays for high-performance computing, merge multiple DataFrames, and clean data by handling missing values. I also learned how to handle time zones, a critical skill for working with time-series data. The week culminated in a capstone project where I built a full data pipeline, from simulation to analysis. The most important lesson was learning to debug a pipeline and ensure the logic is robust and scalable for real-world applications.

Week 2 Summary: Python and SQL Fundamentals
Date Range: 08/25/2025 - 08/29/2025

This week, I shifted my focus to SQL and learned the basics of database querying. I learned how to select, filter, and aggregate data, and I also learned how to use a Python script to connect to a database.

Week 1 Summary: Python Fundamentals
Date Range: 08/20/2025 - 08/24/2025

This week, I focused on the absolute basics of Python. I learned about variables, data types, control flow, loops, and functions. This was a crucial foundation for everything that followed. I also set up my GitHub repository and my VS Code environment to ensure my code was organized and version-controlled.
